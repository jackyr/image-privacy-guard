#### Image Privacy Guard aims to quickly generate new images with one click, remove metadata (which may include GPS and other private information), and generate a different hash value from the original image to enhance the privacy protection capability of the image.

#### Note:
- Due to browser restrictions, when clicking "Privacy Copy" to copy the image to the clipboard, the default format is PNG. If you need to copy in other formats, click the plugin icon, right-click the image in the plugin window, and select the browser's native "Copy Image" option.
- The "Image Quality" option only applies to JPEG and WebP formats, with the default being 100% for other formats.
